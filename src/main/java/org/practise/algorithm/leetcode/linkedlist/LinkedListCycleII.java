/**
 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 *
 * To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to.
 * If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
 *
 * Note: Do not modify the linked list.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: no cycle
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 * Can you solve it without using extra space?
