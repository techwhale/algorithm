/**
 * 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II
 * Medium
 *
 * You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
 *
 * We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
 *
 * Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
 * Output: "abcd"
 * Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
 * Output: "aa"
 * Explanation:
 * First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
 * Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
 * Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
 * Output: "ps"
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 105
 * 2 <= k <= 104
 * s only contains lowercase English letters.
