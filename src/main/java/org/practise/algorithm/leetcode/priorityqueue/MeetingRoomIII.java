/**
 * 2402. Meeting Rooms III
 * Hard
 *
 * You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.
 *
 * Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:
 *
 * Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
 * If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
 * When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
 * Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.
 *
 * A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * - At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
 * - At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
 * - At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
 * - At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
 * - At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
 * - At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
 * Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * - At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
 * - At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
 * - At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
 * - At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
 * - At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
 * - At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
 * - At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
 * Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= meetings.length <= 105
 * meetings[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 105
 * All the values of starti are unique.
