/**
 * There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
 *
 * You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
 *
 * Each child must have at least one candy.
 * Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 * What is the minimum candies you must give?
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [1,0,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [1,2,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
 *              The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
